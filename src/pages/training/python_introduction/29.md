# While-loop

```python
if __name__=="__main__":
    numbers=[1,2,3,4,5]
    list_len=len(numbers)
    #set counter to 0 an product to 1
    i=0
    product_of_numbers=1
    while i<list_len:
        #Multiply the old value for the number at place i
        product_of_numbers=product_of_numbers*numbers[i]
        #the more "pythonic" way to do it is
        #product_of_numbers*=numbers[i]
        #Update counter
        i=i+1
    print(f"The product of the numbers in the list in {product_of_numbers}")
```
