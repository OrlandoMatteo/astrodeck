To use placeholder we need to add the letter _"f"_ before the string, in this case the placeholder is the same for every type of variable and is "_{variable}_", so the example we saw before would become:  

```python
print(f"My name is {myname}")
``` 

In this case if we want to print multiple variable we would write:  

```python
print(f"{a} {b} {c}")
``` 

### Special cases

With this method you can also specify the total number of digits by writing "_{:.**n**}_" where n is the **total** number of digits so if for example we want to write pi with 3 decimal digits we would write  

```python 
pi=3.15169265
print(f"{pi:.4}").  
```
