# How to launch a Python script

Launching a Python script is quite easy, these are the steps to follow:  

1. Open a new terminal (Command line for Windows)
2. Navigate to the folder , "_cd name of the folder_" to open a folder , "_dir_" to list the file in the folder ("_ls_" for MacOS and Linux)
3. type "_python 'name of the file'.py_"(for example "python myScript.py")  

For the rest of the course we will always launch our Python scripts in this way
