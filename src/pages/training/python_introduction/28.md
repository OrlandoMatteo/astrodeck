# How to use the lists?

The easiest way to show how the _for-loop_  and the _while-loop_ works is by making an example. So let's see a script that creates a list with some number and calculates their sum and their product:

## For-loop
```python
if __name__=="__main__":
    numbers=[1,2,3,4,5]
    list_len=len(numbers)
    
    ##For-loop for the sum
    #set sum to 0
    sum_of_numbers=0
    for i in range(list_len):
        #takes the previous value of the sum and add the number at the place i
        sum_of_numbers=sum_of_numbers+numbers[i]
        #the more "pythonic" way to do it is
        #sum_of_numbers+=numbers[i]
    print(f"The sum of the numbers in the list is {sum_of_numbers}")
```
