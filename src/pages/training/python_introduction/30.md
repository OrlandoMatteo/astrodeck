# For-loop in the "pythonic" way

There is another method to write the _for-loop_ that is a little easier that is : `for item in list:` 

Using this method for the previous example it becomes

```python
if __name__=="__main__":
    numbers=[1,2,3,4,5]
    sum_of_numbers=0
    for item in numbers:
        sum_of_numbers+=item
```
