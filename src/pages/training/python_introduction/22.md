# If-elif-else
 
The easiest way to show how _if-elif-else_ works is by making an example. So let's see a script that asks to the user two number and tells if the first is greater, smaller or equal to the second


```python
if __name__=="__main__":
    #Receive two number as input
    a=int(input('Write a number\n'))
    b=int(input('Write another number\n'))
    #First case a>b
    if a>b:
        print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
    #Second case a<b
    elif a<b:
        print(f"{a} is smaller than {b}")
    #All the other case
    else:
        print(f"{a} equals {b}")
```
