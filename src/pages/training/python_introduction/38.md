#  Exercise 10

As we see in this example we don't need to specify the type of the input of the function, python will understand it by itself (by the way this is a special case due to the fact that int,string and list all support the operator "+" in does **not** work) 

As exercise write 4 function to: *add*, *subtract*, *multiply* and *divide* two given numbers and print the result

```python
a=2
b=3
add(a,b)
subtract(a,b)
multiply(a,b)
divide(a,b)
```
